## About Myself

Hi, I am **Faeiz Mahrus (21yo/Male/Bangladesh)**, although I usually go by the alias **`ScatteredCognition`**.  
I can speak, read and write in *Bangla* and *English*, although I have also recently started learning *Hindi* and *Russian*.

## Education

I am currently pursuing a **B.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)** from **BRAC University (BRACu)**.

I also previously attended two semesters in the **University of Chittagong (CU)**, pursuing a **BBA in Accounting**, but I later came to BRACu as I decided that I wanted to pursue a different major.

## Hobbies and Interests

> You can find a list of the things mentioned below by going to the [Hobbylist](./hobbylist.md) section.

I like doing the usual stuff all other people like to do.  
Watching *Anime*, *Movies and TV Shows*, playing *Videogames*, interacting with their fandoms, binging on YouTube Documentries, doomscrolling on social media and online blogs.  
You get the idea.

On the more niche side, my areas of interests involve *Psychology*, *Ancient and Contemporary History*, *Politics*, and  anything that has to do with *Computers and Technology*.
